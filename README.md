IBeaconPoC
==========

This Android app is a proof of concept for detecting iBeacons and logging data for some unspecified future use.

The app scans for iBeacons and writes the details of any iBeacons discovered to a file on the device.
Scanning can be enabled and disabled via a button and the file produced will overwrite any previous versions of the same file.

Uses the free iBeacon SDK from Radius Networks and portions of code adapted from David G Young's IBeacon Reference Application.
